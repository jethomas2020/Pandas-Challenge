HIGH LEVEL OBERVATIONS/TRENDS SUMMARY: 

1. Charter Schools have a higher overall pass rates, as well as higher Math and Reading scores, than the District Schools in the dataset

2. Additionally, the Top 5 Performing schools are Charter Schools while the Bottom 5 Performing Schools are District Schools. 

3. The Schools Summary data show that students have higher Reading Scores than Math Scores amongst all schools reprsented in the dataset.

4. In looking at Spending by School size (per Student), it appears the overall passing rate of students has an inverse relationship with spending ranges per student. 


OVERVIEW: 

Having spent years analyzing financial records for big banks, we've finally scratched our idealistic itch and joined the education sector. In the latest role as Chief Data Scientist for our city's school district we'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, we've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. We'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Our responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Our final report includes each of the following:

District Summary

    Created a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
        Total Schools
        Total Students
        Total Budget
        Average Math Score
        Average Reading Score
        % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
        % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
        % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

School Summary

    Created an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
        School Name
        School Type
        Total Students
        Total School Budget
        Per Student Budget
        Average Math Score
        Average Reading Score
        % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
        % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
        % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

    Created a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:
        School Name
        School Type
        Total Students
        Total School Budget
        Per Student Budget
        Average Math Score
        Average Reading Score
        % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
        % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
        % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

    Created a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Includes all of the same metrics as above.

Math Scores by Grade

    Created a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade

    Created a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending

    Created a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Used 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Included in the table is each of the following:
        Average Math Score
        Average Reading Score
        % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
        % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
        % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

Scores by School Size

    Repeats the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

Scores by School Type

    Repeats the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).

As final considerations:

    Used the pandas library and Jupyter Notebook.
